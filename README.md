# PyBer Analysis

## Overview
1.	Create a PyBer Summary DataFrame
An outcome between three city types was analyzed: Rural, Suburban, and Urban, comparing total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and average fare per driver.
2.	Create a Multiple-Line Plot for the Sum of the Fares for Each City Type
A line plot was created calculating the sum of the fares by city type per month.

## Resources
•	Data Source: ride_data.csv, city_data.csv
•	Software: Python 3.7.4, Jupyter Notebook

Rural cities have lower rides, drivers and total fares compared to suburban and urban, while the avg fare per ride and avg fare per driver are higher. Suburban cities ranked in the middle of both Rural cities and Urban cities for all data points except the average fare per driver being the second highest after Rural. Urban cities ranked the highest in total rides, total drivers, and total fares, and the lowest in avg fare per ride and avg fare per driver probably due to higher competition, shorter distance travelling and higher demand.
